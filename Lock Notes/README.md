# Medeco Duracam
* [My picking video](https://youtu.be/23MHaHG4b7k?si=364pB42eWZhKSs5o)
* 5 pins, no drivers
* Pins must be rotated and lifted to correct position
* Can rotate pins using a flag positioned on the outside (either side) of each pin, and pushing forward/backward
* The pin that is most rigid seems to be the one asking to be set
* A pin that is slightly loose, but not fully loose seems to indicate it is set
* The core will rotate into a progressively deeper false set as you correctly set the pins

# Medeco M3 Mortise
* CCW tensioning allows pin rotation to be determined first, thus engaging the sidebar
* Correct rotation for all pins can be determined by push the check pin. If correct, the core will rotate slightly
* Pin rotation can also be checked individually by seeing if the pin is "clicky" as you slide under it (indicating correct rotation)
* The last pin that needs to be rotated might not feel clicky even if rotated to the correct position
* One tee pin and one tapered spool found in my lock
* Tee pin gives to clicks before set
* Tapered pin gives counter rotation before being set

# Sargent Assa Abloy Mortise
* 6 pins all standard
* Super good tolerances
* More success picking CCW than CW
* Apply enough tension to feel the bound pin sliding up with resistance
* Sometimes feels like a pin is set, but might not be
