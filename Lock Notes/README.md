# Brava Oval
* Heavy bar TOK, .018 Peterson Gem
* Medium tension
* Unsure of model
* Appears to have flat wafer pins
* Multiple notches on each pin
* Just keep lifting the binding pin a notch until you get the open

# Federal 90A
* .050 TOK, .018 Peterson H4
* Light tension (enough to get past core spring tension though)
* 6 pins
* Mix of standard, serrated, spooled
* Goes into a deep false set
* On mine, the first pin kept falling and it was a very high lift
* Seems easy to overset pins
* Similar to American 1100

# Mako 427
* Multipick SP-17 TOK, .08 Peterson H4
* Light tension
* 6 pins
* Mix of standard, serrated, spooled
* Goes into a little false set
* Similar to American 1100

# Master Lock Excell
* .050 TOK, .08 Peterson H4
* Heavy tension
* 5 pins
* All standard
* Very easy to pick

# Medeco Duracam
* [My picking video](https://youtu.be/23MHaHG4b7k?si=364pB42eWZhKSs5o)
* Z bar, Sparrows smooth flag
* 5 pins, no drivers
* Pins must be rotated and lifted to correct position
* Can rotate pins using a flag positioned on the outside (either side) of each pin, and pushing forward/backward
* The pin that is most rigid seems to be the one asking to be set
* A pin that is slightly loose, but not fully loose seems to indicate it is set
* The core will rotate into a progressively deeper false set as you correctly set the pins

# Medeco M3 Mortise
* .050 TOK, Sparrows smooth flag
* CCW tensioning allows pin rotation to be determined first, thus engaging the sidebar
* Correct rotation for all pins can be determined by push the check pin. If correct, the core will rotate slightly
* Pin rotation can also be checked individually by seeing if the pin is "clicky" as you slide under it (indicating correct rotation)
* The last pin that needs to be rotated might not feel clicky even if rotated to the correct position
* One tee pin and one tapered spool found in my lock
* Tee pin gives to clicks before set
* Tapered pin gives counter rotation before being set

# Packlock 200A
* .050 TOK if deep enough, otherwise thin z bar (BOK) style, .018 Peterson H4 & H5 (for deep pins)
* Light tension
* 6 pins
* Mix of standard, serrated, spooled
* Goes into a little false set
* Similar to American 1100

# Sargent Assa Abloy Mortise
* .050 TOK, .018 Peterson Gem
* Apply enough tension to feel the bound pin sliding up with resistance
* 6 pins all standard
* Super good tolerances
* More success picking CCW than CW
* Sometimes feels like a pin is set, but might not be
