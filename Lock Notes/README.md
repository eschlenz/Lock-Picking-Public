  * Can rotate pins using a flag positioned on the outside (either side) of each pin, and pushing forward/backward
  * The pin that is most rigid seems to be the one asking to be set
  * A pin that is slightly loose, but not fully loose seems to indicate it is set

# Medeco M3 Mortise
* [My picking video](https://youtu.be/1w8HsfxLv5I?si=-SLLvbBkWvufKenx)

  * Correct rotation for all pins can be determined by push the check pin. If correct, the core will rotate slightly
  * Pin rotation can also be checked individually by seeing if the pin is "clicky" as you slide under it (indicating correct rotation)
  * The last pin that needs to be rotated might not feel clicky even if rotated to the correct position
  * One tee pin and one tapered spool found in my lock
  * Tee pin gives to clicks before set
  * Tapered pin gives counter rotation before being set
