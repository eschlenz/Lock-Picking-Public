# Ace A527
* TOK .050, .018 Peterson H4/H5
* Light tension
* Padlock
* 5 pins
* Standard and serrated
* Pretty easy

# American Lock 700
* TOK .050, .018 Peterson H4/H5
* Light tension
* Padlock
* 5 pins
* Standard and serrated?
  * I didn't notice any security pins on mine
* Easy

# Brava Oval
* Heavy bar TOK, .018 Peterson Gem
* Medium tension
* Cam lock
* Unsure of model
* Appears to have flat wafer pins
* Multiple notches on each pin
* Just keep lifting the binding pin a notch until you get the open

# Federal 90A
* .050 TOK, .018 Peterson H4
* Light tension (enough to get past core spring tension though)
* Padlock
* 6 pins
* Mix of standard, serrated, spooled
* Goes into a deep false set
* On mine, the first pin kept falling and it was a very high lift
* Seems easy to overset pins
* Similar to American Lock 1100

# Federal 90A
* .050 TOK, .018 Peterson H4/H5
* Light tension (enough to get past core spring tension though)
* Padlock
* 6 pins
* Standard and spooled
* Minor false set

# Hurd USA

* Heavy tension
* Padlock
* 5 pins
* All standard pins
* Easy

# Kwikset Smartkey Gen 2
* [My picking video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kC1vp0_bt5g)
* .050 TOK, .018 Peterson Gem
* Light tension (seriously)
* Padlock
* 5 wafer pins / lots of false gatesx
* Focus on the binding pin and move up one click at a time
* True gate feels much floppier than the false gates
* Lightly dragging under the pins can help find the binder, or nudge pins into the true gate if close but not in it yet
* Tricky lock to pick

# Mako 427
* Multipick SP-17 TOK, .018 Peterson H4
* Light tension
* Padlock
* 6 pins
* Mix of standard, serrated, spooled
* Goes into a little false set
* Similar to American Lock 1100

* .040 TOK, .018 Peterson H1
* Light tension
* Shutter lock
* 4 pins
* Standard, spools
* Very easy to pick

# Master Lock Excell
* .050 TOK, .018 Peterson H4
* Heavy tension
* Padlock
* 5 pins
* All standard
* Very easy to pick

# Master Lock Magnum
* .040 TOK, .025 Peterson Gem
* Heavy tension
* Padlock
* 5 pins
* Spools and standards
* Gross lock, sloppy tolerances, loose core
* Heavy tension is the only thing that makes it tricky

# Master Lock No 5
* .040 TOK, .018 Peterson Gem
* Heavy tension
* Padlock
* 5 pins
* All standard pins
* Very easy

# Master Lock No 570
* .040 TOK, .018 Peterson Gem

* Pretty easy

# Master Lock No 6835

  * Also have one that has standard and serrated pins
* Very easy

# Medeco Duracam
* [My picking video](https://youtu.be/23MHaHG4b7k?si=364pB42eWZhKSs5o)
* Z bar, Sparrows smooth flag
* Cam lock
* 5 pins, no drivers
* Pins must be rotated and lifted to correct position
* Can rotate pins using a flag positioned on the outside (either side) of each pin, and pushing forward/backward
* The pin that is most rigid seems to be the one asking to be set
* A pin that is slightly loose, but not fully loose seems to indicate it is set
* The core will rotate into a progressively deeper false set as you correctly set the pins

# Medeco M3 Mortise
* [My picking video](https://youtu.be/1w8HsfxLv5I?si=-SLLvbBkWvufKenx)
* .050 TOK, Sparrows smooth flag
* CCW tensioning allows pin rotation to be determined first, thus engaging the sidebar
* Mortise Lock
* 6 pins
* Correct rotation for all pins can be determined by push the check pin. If correct, the core will rotate slightly
* Pin rotation can also be checked individually by seeing if the pin is "clicky" as you slide under it (indicating correct rotation)
* The last pin that needs to be rotated might not feel clicky even if rotated to the correct position
* One tee pin and one tapered spool found in my lock
* Tee pin gives to clicks before set
* Tapered pin gives counter rotation before being set

# Packlock 100A
* .050 TOK if deep enough, .018 Peterson H1
* Light tension
* Padlock
* 6 pins
* Mix of standard, serrated, spooled
* Goes into a little false set
* Similar to American Lock 1100

# Packlock 200A
* .050 TOK if deep enough, otherwise thin z bar (BOK) style, .018 Peterson H4 & H5 (for deep pins)

* Mix of standard, serrated, spooled
* Goes into a little false set
* Similar to American Lock 1100

# Sargent Assa Abloy Mortise
