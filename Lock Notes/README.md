# ASSA Twin 6000 Barrels
* [My Picking Video - Original](https://youtu.be/vlOgLHSNWfw?si=0ye73byPKQXdXpno)
* Type: KIK
* Picked: Yes
* Tension wrench: Two wrenches taped together that will fill up the gap enough. Add another tensioner for floating side pins.
* Pick(s): Flag for side pins, Jimylongs .019" medium/deep hook for barrels
* Tension: Varying
* Number of pins: 5 side pins, 6 top pins
* Types of pins: Side pins with false gates, top pins with barrels
* Notes:
   * Order of operations:
      * Must be CW tension on mine (does not isolate in CCW)
      * Set barrels into milling
      * Fully set barrels
      * Set side pins
   * Barrels
      * Phase 1
         * Lots of tension
         * Cycle through pins 1,2,4,5 lifting up the binder little by little until it frees up
         * Also lift ^ the non binders just a tiny amount each time you visit a pin
         * Don't need to touch pin 6 at all
         * Pin 3 might need lifting near the end of phase 1
         * Repeat ^ until one of the following happens suggesting phase
            * Pin 4 starts binding
            * Pin 2 starts binding followed by 4
            * A tiny false set occurs
         * Check for tiny jiggle on each pin before moving on to the sidebar
         * The false set will deepen (possibly imperceptably) when done with the top
      * Phase 2
         * Pin 1 is a sneaky binder because it's so high. Check it often.
         * Early on in phase 2 pins 1,2,4 are likely to be the binders
         * Pin 5 starts binding later, followed by pin 3, and lastly pin 6
         * Pin 4 likes to fall down a lot
         * Pin 2 and 5 also fall down a fair amount but less than 4
         * Pin 1 is a very high lift
         * Pins 3 and 6 are very low lifts
         * Focus on the pin that is binding the hardest and has ZERO movement
         * Compare the feeling to other pins if unsure
         * If more than one pin feels like it's the true binder, try nudging all of the other pins to get a little more core movement
         * If you lose the false set, do the same ^
         * Multiple clicks will be had as the barrel moves up through the countermilling
         * Just move up one click at a time and find the next binder
         * Slowly let off tension while bouncing on the binding pin
         * As tension lets off, and if you're on the right pin, the plug will jostle in the core and movement can be felt in the tensioner
         * A truly set pin will have a tiny bit of movement and spring-back
      * Side Pins:
         * TOK tensioner plus another for true float picking
         * If side pin 1 or 2 are not binding well, probably not done with the top pins
         * Pin 1 up 1 clicks
         * Pin 2 up 2 clicks
         * Pin 3 up 3 clicks
         * Pin 4 up 3 clicks while preventing false set from deepening more than a tiny amount
         * Pin 5 up 2 clicks (pin 4 may fall just a tad)
         * Pin 4 again if necessary
         * Pin 5 expect another tiny half click
         * As long as nothing dropped, start bouncing on pins to ensure they are seated well in their true gates
         * Pin 4 usually is the last one to need touching

# ASSA Twin 6000 Gins
* [My Picking Video - Original](https://youtu.be/olXqgFrCyCE)
* [My Picking Video - Redo](https://youtu.be/P8FWjfhuVRg)
* [My Deep Dive Sidebar Video](https://youtu.be/_pbsqGAMUdU)
* Type: Mortise
* Picked: Yes
* Tension wrench: Two wrenches taped together that will fill up the gap enough
* Pick(s): Flag for side pins, Peterson DD .018" for gins phase 1, Jimylongs .019" medium hook to finish gins
* Tension: Varying
* Number of pins: 5 side pins, 6 top pins
* Types of pins: Side pins with false gates, top pins with gins
* Notes:
   * Order of operations:
      * Set top pins (gins) into countermilling.
      * Set side pins.
      * Fully set top pins (gins) saving pin 4 for as late as possible.
   * Side Pins:
      * CCW tension is easiest.
      * Medium/heavy tension
      * If pin 4 or 5 aren't holding their position, probably need to redo phase 1 gins.
      * Pin 4 up 3 clicks
      * Pin 5 up 3 clicks
      * Pin 2 up 2 clicks
      * Pin 1 up 3 clicks
      * Pin 3 up 1 click
      * Keep lifting pins 1,4,5 as high as they'll go as you revisit
      * Only nudge pin 2 or 3 very slightly if they are binding
      * Will get a deeper false set when picked.
   * Gins
      * Phase 1
         * Get each pin into counter milling
         * Some pins made give multiple clicks
         * Work on it until all pins are loose
         * May detect the smallest of false sets.
      * Phase 2
         * Pick order: 5,6,3,4,2,1
         * Use pin 4 (only non-countermilled chamber) as a reference point. It binds hard.
         * Make sure you are under the pin properly and pulse pressure against it while VERY slowly letting off tension.
         * Expect one click for set indicator on each pin.
         * Pin 4 acts like spool.
         * Pin 1 should open lock, but 6 has tendency to fall down.

# ASSA Twin V10 Gins
* [My Picking Video - Original](https://youtu.be/negWjK7Qj6Y?si=43621XHEXKbSte6X)
* Type: Mortise
* Picked: Yes
* Tension wrench: Custom wrench ground down to fit TOK perfect
* Pick(s): Flag for side pins, Law Lock medium hook for the majority of the top pins, SSDEV .015" deep hook for final setting of the 6th pin
* Tension: Varying
* Number of pins: 5 side pins, 6 top pins
* Types of pins: Side pins with false gates, top pins with gins
* Notes:
   * Order of operations:
      * Set top pins (gins) into countermilling.
      * Set side pins.
      * Fully set top pins (gins) saving pin 4 for as late as possible.
   * Side Pins:
      * CCW tension is easiest.
      * Medium/heavy tension
      * Pin 2 up 2 clicks
      * Pin 3 up 2 clicks
      * Pin 4 up 2 clicks
      * Pin 2 up all the way
      * Pin 3 up all the way
      * Pin 4 up all the way
      * Pin 5 up 1.5 clicks
      * Pin 1 up 1 click
      * Pin 1, 5, or 2 are usually what holds you back if sidebar isn't set after this sequence
   * Gins
      * Phase 1
         * Get each pin into counter milling
         * Pick order: 3,2,1,4,6
         * Pin 5 doesn't need to be touched, possibly because it's already in the milling or because lifting 6 gets it there
      * Phase 2
         * Pick order: 5,2,1,4,6
         * Pin 3 is a standard pin so no need to do anything
         * Pin 6 is difficult to identify and needs to be lifted high by the SSDEV deep hook. Find it by going to the back of the lock and feeling your way forward, or use pin 5 (very low pin) as a reference.

# EVVA ICS
# [My picking video](https://youtu.be/zhpDa8Lffy0?si=oo6WiTS-gLyWqYFi)
* [My deep dive video](https://youtu.be/QFXKq4Q7f3Y?si=Z-qbZDhwBe5knBR6)
* Type: Euro Cylinder
* Picked: Yes
* Tension wrench: Sparrows Z bar + silver extended Z bar
* Pick(s): SSDEV style hook + DIY flag
* Tension: Very heavy / float
* Number of pins: 3 + 10 finger pins (5 per side)
* Types of pins: Standard and finger pins with 2 false gates and one true gate each
* Notes:
  * I picked CCW
  * Picks in 3 phases: top pins, left side bar, right side bar (flip side bar order if CW picking)
  * Top pins are standard, but awkward because they have a fin protrusion. Easy to set once you get on them
  * Finger pins like to ping pong like crazy
  * To combat ping ponging, heavy tension and force finger pins up into their true gates
  * Finger pins in true gate will be slightly jiggly
  * Top pins like to fall down early on in the finger pin picking, so double check them from time to time
  * Some finger pins are very high lift and require a hook to get them all the way home
  * Mostly used DIY flag to pick finger pins
  * On my lock, L2 and L5 are "zero lift" pins, and R3 is as well
  * Zero lift does not always mean zero lift. Might need a slight nudge to get set
  * Keep DIY flag pick as flat against the warding as possible to keep it parallel with the core
  * On my lock:
     * Left side: lift L4 (highest) first, then L3 (high), then L1 (high)
     * Right side: lift R2 one notch, then R2 to true gate (high). Then either R4 and R5 (low) or R1 (high)

# Medeco Keymark Mortise
* [My picking video](https://youtu.be/_2G9onSGEDI)
* Type: Mortise
* Picked: Yes
* Tension wrench: TOK .050
* Pick(s): 15C SSDEV
* Tension: Medium-light / float
* Number of pins: 6 (7 chamgers)
* Types of pins: All standard. Every pin has a master wafer.
* Notes:
   * See Keymark SFIC Keyway notes since it's exactly the same.
   * Binding order: 4, 5, 6, 3, 1, 2
   * Pin 1 is a high lift

# Medeco Keymark SFIC
* Type: SFIC
* Picked: Yes (to operating only)
* Tension wrench: TOK .050
* Pick(s): 15C SSDEV
* Tension: Medium-light / float
* Number of pins: 7
* Types of pins: Standard and spools. Keypins may also have some spools.
* Notes:
   * Keymark Keyway:
      * Though the keyway looks daunting, it can be navigated from the BOK
      * Line the pick up at the very bottom-left, with the pick oriented parallel to the keyway
      * By moving the pick straight up you can access each pin
      * Warding between the pins will get in the way, so practice without the tension wrench to get the feel
      * If you have the distance from pin to pin down in muscle memory, you can trust you are on a binder more versus the warding
      * Letting off tension and poking can help determine warding versus pins
   * My Keymark SFIC
      * Operating
         * Binding order: 5, 4, 6, 2, 1, 3, 7
         * Pin 4 is a small movement to set
         * Pins 1, 2, and 3 are higher lifts and give counter rotation
         * Pin 7 needs float picking backwards to get it into position

# Medeco Duracam
* [My picking video](https://youtu.be/23MHaHG4b7k?si=364pB42eWZhKSs5o)
* Type: Cam lock
* Picked: Yes
* Tension wrench: Z bar
* Pick(s): Sparrows smooth flag
* Tension: Varying tension
* Number of pins: 5 (no drivers)
* Types of pins: Medeco (dowel hole and serrations)
* Notes: 
  * Pins must be rotated and lifted to correct position
  * Can rotate pins using a flag positioned on the outside (either side) of each pin, and pushing forward/backward
  * The pin that is most rigid seems to be the one asking to be set
  * A pin that is slightly loose, but not fully loose seems to indicate it is set
  * The core will rotate into a progressively deeper false set as you correctly set the pins

# Medeco M3 Mortise
* [My picking video](https://youtu.be/1w8HsfxLv5I?si=-SLLvbBkWvufKenx)

* Types of pins: Medeco
* Notes:
  * Correct rotation for all pins can be determined by push the check pin. If correct, the core will rotate slightly
  * Pin rotation can also be checked individually by seeing if the pin is "clicky" as you slide under it (indicating correct rotation)
  * The last pin that needs to be rotated might not feel clicky even if rotated to the correct position
  * One tee pin and one tapered spool found in my lock
  * Tee pin gives to clicks before set
  * Tapered pin gives counter rotation before being set 

# Mul-T-Lock MT5+
* [My picking video](https://youtu.be/Kn4lHAX0o24?si=9J4_eojo8nivb_3_)
* Type: Euro
* Picked: Yes
* Tension wrench: Left side Z wrench with sides ground to prevent catching on the lock housing
* Pick(s): .015" Peterson Gem for alpha pin, MP04 for pins, MP10 for sliders
* Tension: Varying tension
* Number of pins: 5 + alpha pin, 5 sliders
* Types of pins: Pin in pin, Sliders
* Notes:
  * CCW tension
  * Order of operations
    * No tension, move all sliders to the far right and rake the pins
    * Set alpha pin by sliding the Peterson Gem towards the back. You're feeling for a little bump. When you reach the bump, let off tension as you slide the pick forward. You should get a notable click, otherwise repeat the previous steps and try again.
    * Start getting clicks out of outer/inner pins (see below) until you get a minor false set
    * Set sliders
    * Finish setting pins
 * Pins
   * Alpha pin first
   * Pin 2 outer 1 click
   * Pin 3 outer 1 click
   * Pin 1 outer 1 click
   * Pin 2 (outer/inner?) 1 click
   * Pin 3 (outer/inner?) 1 click. (Doesn't always happen).
   * Pin 4 outer? tiny click. If no click, the previous steps aren't done properly.
   * Pin 5 tiny click.
   * Expect a minor false set soon. May need to jostle pins until it happens. Seems like any pin can be the one that gives the false set eventually.
   * After setting sliders, keep setting pins. Just feel for binders and try to get clicks out of them. Eventually you should get a deeper false set meaning just inners are left.
   * Inner pins are easy and give tiny clicks.
   * Remember, pin 1 has an inner pin that sits higher than the outer pin.
* Sliders
   * Slider positions: 1 - far left, 2 - far right, 3 - mid left, 4 - mid left, 5 - far right
   * With your flag rest it pointing down flush against the right wall. Move forward while keeping CCW tension on the pick until you drop into the chamber.
   * DO NOT MOVE SLIDERS 2 OR 5. They are already in the correct position on the far right.
   * Set slider 1 first by letting off tension and trying to pick it. It needs to be as far left as it can go.
   * Set slider 3 next, but it shouldn't move as far left as slider 1
   * Set slider 4 next, but it shouldn't move as far left as slider 1
