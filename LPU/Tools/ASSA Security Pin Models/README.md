# ASSA Pin Models

ASSA security pins recreated in CAD and exported as STLs in different sizes. Includes gin, barrel, and side pin. 

Step files are also included.

If you are looking for pins of different sizes that match what comes in these locks, there are configurations defined for the
corresponding A, B, C, and D sized pins. That, plus the rest of the original CAD stuff, can be found here:
