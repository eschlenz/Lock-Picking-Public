# GEGE MRT Picking/Training/Key Cloning Tools

## About
This is a set of tools for designed for specifically for GEGE MRT lock. It includes tools for picking the lock,
training to pick the lock, and key cloning. This set of tools was created as an alternative to the traditional
approach to picking this lock (piano wire/metal pick + magnet). It's primary purpose is to help one learn to
pick these locks by allowing the user to precisely and controllable manipulate the rotors within the MRT. It is
not, however, a substitute for acquiring the necessary skills to pick this lock in a more traditional manner 
(my opinion).

This set of tools supports two different size magnets: 2mmx1mm (disc) and 3mmx1mm (disc). Additionally, two
pick thicknesses are offered to ensure a proper fit and free movement of the pick within the lock.

## Rationale
Learning to pick this lock is a unique challenge. The conventional approach is to use bent piano wire as a
tensioner, and an old pick with a magnet super glued to the tip to manipulate the rotors. Manipulating the
rotors and controlling tension requires a lot of practice. The motion of the pick to move the rotors, 
specifically, is one that requires a lot of training to get the muscle memory down. The point of the tools
provided here is to more easily get acquainted with how to manipulate the rotors, in a more controlled and
repeatable manner. As a bonus it is nice to have a way to clone the key and observe the rotors as you 
manipulate them. This solution aims to provide a complete set of tools to both learn to pick the lock, but
also understand exactly how it works.
