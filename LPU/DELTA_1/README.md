# About
This page documents my first challenge lock created to fulfill the LPU blue belt requirements. I've named this lock "Delta 1". Below you will find details about this
challenge lock.

"Delta 1" has a teal triangle engraved (poorly) into the key and the bible. This was my first attempt at engraving with a Dremel, and it wasn't awesome. Nevertheless, it adds a visual element to my creation.
